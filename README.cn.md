# riscv-ecosystem-tracking

提供一种比 riscv-software-list 更加详细的方式展示 RISC-V 软件生态的完备性程度，为业界决策何时选用 RISC-V 提供高价值情报。

Provides more detailed information (compared with the [riscv-software-list](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-software-list))  for potential RISC-V users.

It is maintained by Wei Wu as a side project of the PLCT Lab. Pull Requests are welcome!
